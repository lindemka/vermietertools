# Security Fixes - Data Exposure Vulnerability

## Problem Identified
After user registration, the application was showing ALL properties from the database to every user, regardless of ownership. This was a critical security vulnerability that allowed users to see other users' property data.

## Root Cause
1. **Incomplete Session Management**: The session system was not properly implemented - `getSession()` always returned `null`
2. **Missing Authentication Checks**: API routes were not checking if users were authenticated
3. **Missing Authorization Checks**: API routes were not filtering data by user ownership
4. **Database Schema**: Missing Session model for proper session storage

## Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added Session Model**: Created proper session storage in the database
- **Session Fields**: `id`, `token`, `userId`, `expiresAt`, `createdAt`
- **Relationships**: Session belongs to User with cascade delete

### 2. Session Management Fixes
- **lib/session.ts**: Implemented proper session creation, retrieval, and destruction
- **Session Storage**: Sessions now stored in database with expiration
- **Session Validation**: Proper token verification and expiration checking
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

### 3. Authentication System Fixes
- **app/api/auth/login/route.ts**: Updated to use proper session creation
- **app/api/auth/logout/route.ts**: Updated to use proper session destruction
- **Session Cookies**: Proper HTTP-only, secure cookie configuration

### 4. API Route Security Fixes

#### Properties API (`/api/properties`)
- **GET**: Now only returns properties belonging to authenticated user
- **POST**: Requires authentication, assigns properties to authenticated user
- **PUT**: Requires authentication, verifies property ownership
- **DELETE**: Requires authentication, verifies property ownership

#### Units API (`/api/units`)
- **GET**: Requires authentication, verifies unit belongs to user's property
- **POST**: Requires authentication, verifies property ownership
- **PUT**: Requires authentication, verifies unit ownership
- **DELETE**: Requires authentication, verifies unit ownership

#### Rentals API (`/api/rentals`)
- **GET**: Requires authentication, verifies rental belongs to user's unit
- **POST**: Requires authentication, verifies unit ownership
- **PUT**: Requires authentication, verifies rental ownership
- **DELETE**: Requires authentication, verifies rental ownership

#### Individual Property API (`/api/properties/[id]`)
- **GET**: Requires authentication, verifies property ownership

#### Property Rentals Overview (`/api/properties/[id]/rentals-overview`)
- **GET**: Requires authentication, verifies property ownership

#### Unit Standard Rent (`/api/units/[id]/standard-rent`)
- **PUT**: Requires authentication, verifies unit ownership

#### Unit Yearly Overview (`/api/units/[id]/yearly-overview`)
- **GET**: Requires authentication, verifies unit ownership
- **POST**: Requires authentication, verifies unit ownership

### 5. Authorization Pattern Implemented
All API routes now follow this security pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Get current user session
const session = await getSession()

// 2. Check authentication
if (!session) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Nicht authentifiziert' },
    { status: 401 }
  )
}

// 3. Verify ownership using findFirst with user filter
const resource = await prisma.resource.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: resourceId,
    // Add ownership filter based on relationship
    property: {
      userId: session.userId
    }
  }
})

// 4. Check authorization
if (!resource) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Ressource nicht gefunden oder Zugriff verweigert' },
    { status: 404 }
  )
}
```

## Security Improvements

### Data Isolation
- Users can only see their own properties, units, and rentals
- All database queries now include user ownership filters
- No cross-user data exposure possible

### Authentication Enforcement
- All sensitive API endpoints require valid session
- Session tokens stored securely in database
- Automatic session expiration and cleanup

### Authorization Enforcement
- Ownership verification on all CRUD operations
- Consistent error messages for unauthorized access
- Proper HTTP status codes (401 for auth, 404 for authorization)

### Session Security
- HTTP-only cookies
- Secure flag in production
- Database-backed session storage
- Automatic expiration handling

## Issues Discovered During Testing

### Login Functionality Issue
**Problem**: Login was returning 500 errors after implementing session management.

**Root Cause**: 
1. **Conflicting Functions**: `lib/auth.ts` had an old `createSession` function that conflicted with the new one in `lib/session.ts`
2. **Prisma Client**: The Prisma client needed to be regenerated after adding the Session model

**Solution**:
1. **Removed Old Functions**: Cleaned up `lib/auth.ts` by removing the old session functions
2. **Regenerated Prisma Client**: Ran `npx prisma generate` to include the new Session model
3. **Restarted Server**: Restarted the development server to pick up the new Prisma client

**Result**: Login now works correctly with proper session creation and storage.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Register multiple users** and verify they can't see each other's data
2. **Test session expiration** by waiting for sessions to expire
3. **Test unauthorized access** by trying to access other users' resources
4. **Verify logout** properly destroys sessions
5. **Test API endpoints** with and without authentication
6. **Test login functionality** with valid and invalid credentials

## Migration Required
Run the database migration to add the Session table:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-sessions
npx prisma generate
```

## Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added Session model
- `lib/session.ts` - Implemented proper session management
- `lib/auth.ts` - Cleaned up old session functions
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Updated session creation
- `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts` - Updated session destruction
- `app/api/properties/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization
- `app/api/units/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization
- `app/api/rentals/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization
- `app/api/properties/[id]/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization
- `app/api/properties/[id]/rentals-overview/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization
- `app/api/units/[id]/standard-rent/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization
- `app/api/units/[id]/yearly-overview/route.ts` - Added auth and authorization

## Security Status
✅ **CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FIXED**: Users can no longer see other users' data
✅ **Authentication**: Proper session-based authentication implemented
✅ **Authorization**: User-based data filtering implemented
✅ **Session Management**: Secure session storage and management
✅ **API Security**: All sensitive endpoints protected
✅ **Login Functionality**: Fixed and working correctly
